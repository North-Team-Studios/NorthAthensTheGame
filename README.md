# North Athens - Unreal Engine 5.3

## Deforestation has become the planet's greatest enemy.

North Athens, a city that should be a model for the world, turned into a stage for an accident that turned the population into the living dead.

Now, Clide, an unsuspecting agent who was sent with the mission of restoring the city's environment, needs to survive the chaos armed only with a pistol.

Go on a survival adventure and help Clide restore the city in this third-person, fixed-aim Zombie Survival game.

Game Jam Plus submission game for Bored Cat Studio (formerly North Team Studios), Brazil.
